## Content
  1. [**Facial Keypoints Detection**](https://github.com/MohamedAskar/Computer-Vision-Nanodegree/tree/master/1.%20Facial%20Keypoints%20Detector)<br/>
  In this project, We try to build a model using Haar Cascading algorithm and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can predict Facial Keypoints. The model takes an image with any number of faces on it and it predicts for each face the 68 distingusing keypoint.<br/>
